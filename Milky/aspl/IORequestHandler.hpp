//! Handler for I/O requests to device.
//!
//! Device invokes methods of this class when HAL requests it to perform I/O
//! operations. All actual I/O happens here.
//!
//! What methods are invoked depends on whether the device has input and output
//! streams and what is the value of DeviceParameters::EnableMixing.
//!
//! All methods of this class are invoked on realtime thread and thus they
//! should not call blocking operations.
//!
//! It's safe to invoke any GetXXX() and ApplyProcessing() method. It's not
//! safe to invoke any SetXXX() and AddXXX() method and any other method
//! that is modifying object's state.
